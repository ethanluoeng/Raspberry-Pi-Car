# ☀️ Solar-Powered Lawn Mower

A 4-month mechanical engineering project by Ethan Luo to design and prototype a solar-powered, semi-autonomous lawn mower. The mower uses a 3D printed chassis, solar energy for power, and a Raspberry Pi for control and logic.

## 🧠 Project Overview

The goal of this project is to develop a functional lawn mower that:
- Is powered entirely by solar energy with battery storage
- Uses a Raspberry Pi for control logic and motor operation
- Features a lightweight, 3D-printed body
- Can be remotely or autonomously operated (WIP)

## 🛠 Features

- **Solar Energy System**: Includes solar panels, charge controller, and Li-ion battery pack
- **Raspberry Pi Controller**: Manages motor control and sensor input via Python scripts
- **Custom 3D Printed Frame**: Designed using Fusion 360 / Onshape
- **Drive & Blade Motor System**: Independent motors for wheels and cutting blade
- **(Optional) Sensors**: Obstacle detection via ultrasonic/IR; GPS for autonomous navigation
